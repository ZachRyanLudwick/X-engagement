# MongoDB Integration Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to implement MongoDB integration for user authentication in the X-Engage AI Assistant application.

## Backend Changes

### 1. Dependencies Added

Added the following packages to `requirements.txt`:
- `pymongo==4.6.0` - MongoDB driver for Python
- `motor==3.3.1` - Async MongoDB driver for Python
- `passlib==1.7.4` - Password hashing library
- `python-jose==3.3.0` - JWT token handling
- `bcrypt==4.0.1` - Password hashing algorithm

### 2. Configuration

Updated `app/core/config.py` to include MongoDB connection settings:
- Added `MONGODB_URL` setting
- Added `MONGODB_DB_NAME` setting
- Added `ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES` setting

### 3. Database Connection

Created `app/core/database.py` to handle MongoDB connection:
- Added `MongoDB` class for connection management
- Added functions to connect to and disconnect from MongoDB
- Added helper functions to get collections

### 4. Security

Created `app/core/security.py` for authentication security:
- Added password hashing functions
- Added JWT token generation functions

### 5. User Service

Created `app/services/user_service.py` to handle user operations:
- Added user creation function
- Added user authentication function
- Added user retrieval function
- Added authentication response generation function

### 6. API Routes

Updated `app/api/v1/user.py` to use MongoDB for authentication:
- Added registration endpoint
- Updated login endpoint to use OAuth2 password flow
- Added JWT token-based authentication
- Added user profile endpoint
- Updated other endpoints to use the current user

### 7. Application Startup

Updated `main.py` to connect to MongoDB on startup:
- Added event handlers for startup and shutdown
- Connected to MongoDB on application startup
- Closed MongoDB connection on application shutdown

### 8. Testing

Added tests for MongoDB integration:
- Created `tests/test_mongodb_connection.py` to test MongoDB connection
- Added tests for user creation and authentication

## Frontend Changes

### 1. Authentication Service

Updated `frontend/src/services/authService.js`:
- Modified login function to use form data for OAuth2 compatibility
- Updated register function to match the new API structure

## Documentation

Added documentation for MongoDB setup:
- Created `backend/MONGODB_SETUP.md` with setup instructions
- Added troubleshooting tips
- Added information about the database structure

## How It Works

1. **User Registration**:
   - User submits registration form
   - Backend creates a new user in MongoDB with hashed password
   - JWT token is generated and returned to the frontend
   - Frontend stores the token in localStorage

2. **User Login**:
   - User submits login form
   - Backend authenticates the user against MongoDB
   - JWT token is generated and returned to the frontend
   - Frontend stores the token in localStorage

3. **Authentication**:
   - Frontend includes the JWT token in the Authorization header
   - Backend validates the token and retrieves the user
   - User is authenticated for protected routes

4. **Profile and Settings**:
   - User profile and settings are stored in MongoDB
   - Frontend retrieves and updates them through the API

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Database Integration**:
   - Implement full CRUD operations for user settings
   - Add MongoDB integration for content storage
   - Add MongoDB integration for analytics

2. **Security Enhancements**:
   - Add token refresh mechanism
   - Implement token blacklisting for logout
   - Add rate limiting for authentication endpoints

3. **Testing**:
   - Add more comprehensive tests for authentication
   - Add integration tests for the full authentication flow
