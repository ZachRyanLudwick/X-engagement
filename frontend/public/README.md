# Public Assets

This directory contains the public assets for the X-Engage AI Assistant application.

## Required Files

The following files need to be added manually as they are binary files:

1. `favicon.ico` - The favicon for the application
2. `logo192.png` - A 192x192 pixel logo for the application
3. `logo512.png` - A 512x512 pixel logo for the application

These files are referenced in the `manifest.json` file and are used by browsers and mobile devices when the application is installed as a PWA.
